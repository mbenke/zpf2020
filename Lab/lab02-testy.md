# QuickCheck
* Try out tests using `doctest` and `HUnit`
* Write a few tests for sorting [Int]
* Write a few properties for  functions on lists (++,concat,map,etc.)
* Write a generator for OrderedInts (increasing [Int])
* Write a generator for some type of trees (e.g. BST) and use it in tests
* Basing on the lecture notes, recreate  QuickCheck v1 (and improve it)
